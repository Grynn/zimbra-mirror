I queued up Alma, Allendale, and Cleary for tonight before I left the office.  I expect the latter two will be completed tonight, then the queue will have room for CCS Sunday and Monday early morning.

I expect Alma and CCS to run over into Tuesday morning, but it may go faster.

I just moved another account to each mail host and I am NOT seeing the issue with the folder list.  
It is also worth noting that I did not purge the originals (Justin had suggested this could be a memcache issue)

So we're all set to start moving these tonight / tomorrow.   

Alma - mm-ms02
Cleary - mm-ms04
CCS - mm-ms05
Allendale - mm-ms08
