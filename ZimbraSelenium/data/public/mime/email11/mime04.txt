United Airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The air=
craft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, during w=
hich it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. In 1985, the 76=
7 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for=
 extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop s=
ervice on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing ini=
tiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the develop=
ment of the 777, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became t=
he most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North Am=
erica and Europe.

The 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths. The original 767-200 entered=
 service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an ext=
ended-range (ER) variant, in 2000. The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300=
ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a productio=
n freighter version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs hav=
e modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, whi=
le military derivatives include the E-767 surveillance aircraft, the KC-767=
 and KC-46 aerial tankers, and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 =
include the General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney JT9D and PW4000, and Roll=
s-Royce RB211 turbofans.

The Boeing 767 is a mid-size, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by B=
oeing Commercial Airplanes. It was the manufacturer's first wide-body twinj=
et and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has t=
wo turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag=
, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner tha=
n preceding aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has a capacity of 181 to 375 =
persons and a design range of 3,850 to 6,385 nautical miles (7,130 to 11,82=
5 km), depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with=
 a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which =
allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.
