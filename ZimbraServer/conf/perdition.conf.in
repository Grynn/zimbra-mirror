# perdition.conf
#
# Sample configuration file for perdition.  The file consists of two
# kind of lines, those which have some effect and those which do not.
#
# Comment lines and blank lines have no effect, i.e. they are ignored.
# All other lines refer to perdition options, and the values of those
# options.  The options are the same as those specified on the command
# line and can be specified either on the command line or in the file.
#
# If an option is specified both on the command line and in the file,
# the value in the file is ignored.  Options which make no sense in
# the file such as 'help' and 'config_file' are ignored.  Any syntax
# errors in the file cause perdition to print the 'help' information
# and exit without further processing.
#
# For each option specified in the file, one line is required in the
# file.  As an aid to legibility, blank lines and continuation lines
# are permitted, see below.
#
# There are two different types of option: boolean and non-boolean.
# Depending on the type of option, a line in the configuration file
# must be in one of two formats.
#
# Boolean options such as -d (--debug) or -i (--inetd_mode) can take
# the boolean values TRUE or FALSE.  If a boolean option is mentioned
# in the configuration file it takes the value TRUE, and this has the
# same effect as specifying it on the command line.  The default value
# is FALSE (the same as not specifying it on the command line) and if
# the option is not required simply comment out the line or delete it
# from the configuration file.
#
# Non-boolean options take values which are specified as text strings.
# Strings may be quoted or unquoted as you choose.  A text string
# value may be empty ("") in which case the option will not be used
# unless noted otherwise.
#
# For options taking non-boolean values a line in the configuration
# file is of the floolwing form (the quotes are usually optional)
#
# "option" "value"
#
# Blank lines are ignored, as is a '#' (hash) and anything after it
# unless the hash is escaped with a '\' (backslash).  If a backslash
# immediately precedes a new line then the following line will be
# concatenated.  If a '\' precedes any other character, including a
# '#' or '\' it will be treated as a literal.  Anything inside single
# quotes (') will be treated as a literal.  Anything other than a (')
# inside double quotes (") will be treated as a literal.  Whitespace
# in options must be escaped or quoted.  Whitespace in values need not
# be escaped or quoted.
#
# See the perdition(8) man page for more details about the behaviour
# of options.
#
# You can use either the long form or the short form of any option.
# When you use an option in the file, omit the leading '--' from the
# long form or the leading '-' from the short.  For example to get
# debugging output simply include a line containing the word 'debug'
# in the file, or alternativey a line containing just the letter 'd'.
#
# The defaults given in this file refer to the values if perdition is
# configured with --sysconfdir=/etc as it would be for many binary
# distributions.  To see the actual defaults of a given perdition
# binary, run "perdition --help".
