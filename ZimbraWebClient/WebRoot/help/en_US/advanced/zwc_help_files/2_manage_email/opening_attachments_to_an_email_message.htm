<p class="FM_1HeadingC">Opening Attachments to an Email Message</p>
<p class="FM_Body">Email messages can include attached files such as word 
 processing documents, spreadsheets, text files, ZIP files, images, executable 
 applications, or any other type of computer file that resides on the sender's 
 computer network. Messages that contain attachments display a paper clip 
 next to the subject.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">You can open any file attachment directly from your 
 account, provided that you have the right application and the extension 
 is not blocked by your system administrator.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">If the file type is one that is supported by the installed 
 software on your computer, you can typically double-click the file and 
 your computer automatically launches the right application for reading 
 that file.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">Computer viruses are often spread via file attachments. 
 Therefore, system administrators might block incoming email containing 
 certain types of attachments, often with the extension .EXE or .ZIP as 
 part of their filename.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">Computer viruses can spread through email attachments. 
 It is considered standard practice for system administrators to implement 
 virus filtering for incoming mail as well as virus scanning for personal 
 computers. However, there is always a chance that something could get 
 through.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">In the case of email viruses, the majority of them are 
 activated when a file attachment containing the virus is opened or viewed. 
 Many of these viruses have been known to spread themselves using entries 
 in users' address books. Therefore, we recommend that you use care when 
 opening file attachments, even from senders who appear to be known to 
 you.</p>
<p class="FM_2Heading">View Attachments</p>
<p class="FM_Body">To view an attachment open the message:</p>
<p class="FM_Bulleted2"><span class="FM_bullet2">•<span style="word-spacing: normal; 
														 font: 6.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span>Click 
 the name of the attachment to open the attachment (if you have the correct 
 application available).</p>
<p class="FM_Bulleted2"><span class="FM_bullet2">•<span style="word-spacing: normal; 
														 font: 6.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span>Click 
 <span class="FM_attribute">Download</span>&#160;to choose whether to open 
 the file or save it on your computer. If you choose <span class="FM_attribute">Save 
 to Disk</span>, a browser dialog box appears so that you can choose where 
 to save the file. </p>
<p class="FM_bullet1continued">The file is still attached to the message 
 until you remove it.</p>
<p class="FM_2Heading">Preview Attachments</p>
<p class="FM_Body">If you have the Preview option, you can quickly view 
 the content of the attachment without having to download or open the attachment.</p>
<p class="FM_numbers1step"><span class="FM_BulletSymbol">• </span><span 
	 style="word-spacing: normal; font: 6.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>To 
 preview an attachment click<span class="FM_attribute"> Preview</span>&#160;to 
 open the attachment even if the application is not installed on your network.</p>
<p class="FM_2Heading">Remove Attachments</p>
<p class="FM_Body">Attachments to your email affect your quota. You may 
 want to remove larger attachments from the message. Removing the attachment 
 deletes the file from your mailbox. If you downloaded the file, you still 
 have a copy.</p>
<p class="FM_numbers1step"><span class="FM_BulletSymbol">• <span style="word-spacing: normal; 
	 font: 6.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span>To 
 remove an attachment open the message and click <span class="FM_attribute">Remove</span>.
