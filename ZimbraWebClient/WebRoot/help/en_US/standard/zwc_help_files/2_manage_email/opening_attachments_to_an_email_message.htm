<p class="FM_1HeadingC">Opening Attachments to an Email Message</p>
<p class="FM_Body">Email messages can include attached files such as word 
 processing documents, spreadsheets, text files, ZIP files, images, executable 
 applications, or any other type of computer file that resides on the sender's 
 computer network. Messages that contain attachments display a paper clip 
 next to the subject.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">You can open any file attachment directly from your 
 account, provided that you have the right application and the extension 
 is not blocked by your system administrator.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">If the file type is one that is supported by the installed 
 software on your computer, you can typically double-click the file and 
 your computer automatically launches the right application for reading 
 that file.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">Computer viruses are often spread via file attachments. 
 Therefore, system administrators might block incoming email containing 
 certain types of attachments, often with the extension .EXE 
 or .ZIP as part of their filename.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">Computer viruses can spread through email attachments. 
 It is considered standard practice for system administrators to implement 
 virus filtering for incoming mail as well as virus scanning for personal 
 computers. However, there is always a chance that something could get 
 through.</p>
<p class="FM_Body">In the case of email viruses, the majority of them are 
 activated when a file attachment containing the virus is opened or viewed. 
 Many of these viruses have been known to spread themselves using entries 
 in users' address books. Therefore, we recommend that you use care when 
 opening file attachments, even from senders who appear to be known to 
 you.</p>
