        <h1>Release Notes for Sencha Cmd 3.1.2</h1>
        <p class="notes">
            Date: May 15, 2013<br>
            Version Number: 3.1.2.342<br>
            <a href="../3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-windows.exe.zip">Windows</a> -
            <a href="../3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-osx.app.zip">Mac OS X</a> -
            <a href="../3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-linux-x64.run.zip">Linux/64</a> -
            <a href="../3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-linux.run.zip">Linux/32</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Noteworthy</h2>
        <p>This maintenance release contains improvements and fixes for many issues
            reported by our friend in the community. Many issues relate to the whole
            <tt>sencha app upgrade</tt> process, the meaning of "merge conflicts" and
            cases where Cmd did not handle those conflicts cleanly.
        
        <h3>Framework Packages</h3>

        <p>Packages were introduced in Sencha Cmd 3.1.0. In that release, there was only
            one location for packages and that was set by <tt>workspace.package.dir</tt>
            to be <tt>${workspace.dir}/packages</tt>. This meant that Ext JS 4.2's (many)
            packages would be copied to that folder.

        <p>In this release, frameworks can now contain their packages and these are no
            longer copied out of the framework when the framework is introduced to the
            workspace.

        <p>This detail was handled by Sencha Cmd, so this applies to Ext JS 4.2.0 as well
            as Ext JS 4.2.1. This is handled during framework upgrade and Sencha Cmd will
            remove the framework's packages from the <tt>workspace.packages.dir</tt>.
        
        <h3>Upgrades</h3>

        <p>The general method for upgrading an application is <tt>sencha app upgrade</tt>
            and while that remains true in this release, you now have more control over
            the process. If you have multiple applications in a workspace, for example,
            you need to decouple the framework and application upgrades. By default,
            <tt>sencha app upgrade</tt> now operates as if you specified
            <tt>sencha app upgrade --noframework</tt> and proceeds to upgrade the current
            application to the current framework. This presupposes that you have already
            upgraded the framework as part of a upgrading a different application in the
            workspace.

        <p>If you have created packages, you can upgrade them like so from the package
            folder:

<pre>sencha package upgrade</pre>

        <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you are not upgrading frameworks, you may have to manually
            delete the <tt>"ext-*"</tt> packages from the <tt>"packages"</tt> folder and
            the <tt>"ext"</tt> folder as well. Then run the following to copy the framework
            and packages to the workspace:

<pre>sencha -sdk /path/to/extjs generate workspace .</pre>

        <h3>app.js</h3>

        <p>The majority of upgrade issues revolved around the <tt>"app.js"</tt> file. In
            previous releases, Sencha Cmd would add entries to <tt>"app.js"</tt> during
            code generation calls like <tt>sencha generate model</tt> (but also for
            controllers and the rest). Further, the location of this file differed by
            framework.

        <p>Due to the complications this approach creates and the fact that often these
            updates are not wanted on the application, <span class="hilite">these commands
            no longer update<tt>"app.js"</tt></span>. You will need to add the newly created
            controllers, views, stores, etc. to the appropriate class. In many cases this
            will be on one of your controllers and not your application.

        <p>To make applications consistent across frameworks, and compatible-by-default
            with Sencha Architect, <tt>"app.js"</tt> now resides in the root folder of
            generated applications. The <tt>sencha app upgrade</tt> command will move
            this file from the <tt>"app"</tt> folder for Ext JS applications.
            
        <h3>Merge Conflicts</h3>

        <p>With Sencha Cmd 3.0, we introduced tracking of generated code to allow upgrades
            to reconcile changes you may have made with changes to the "standard" flavor
            of certain key files. This is tracked in <tt>".sencha/app/codegen.json"</tt>.
            When generating code, if there is a file in the way, Cmd will use this data
            to do a 3-way merge with the version Cmd originally produced as the base,
            the version in the way as "Custom" and the new version as "Generated". In
            the case of overlapping changes, Cmd will report s "MERGE CONFLICT" in the
            log and write the standard (at least to many source control systems) conflict
            indicators in the file:

<pre>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Generated
// change to Cmd generated content
=======
// changes you have made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Custom</pre>

        <p>In this release we have fixed several cases where merge conflicts were falsely
            reported during <tt>sencha app upgrade</tt> (which regenerates certain core
            files like <tt>"app.js"</tt>) and cases where subsequent steps of the upgrade
            would wrongly try to use a file containing merge conflicts.
            
        <p>There are two strategies for handling merge conflicts:
        <ul>
            <li>Your source control comparison tools
            <li>Call a merge tool of your choice during the upgrade process to resolve
                conflicts as they occur.
        </ul>

        <p>The use of source control to review the resulting changes from an upgrade is
            not new. The best practice here (as always) is to perform upgrades with a
            clean working tree (no pending changes). This will allow you to discard or
            revert whatever you need.

        <h3>Using a Third-party Merge Tool</h3>

        <p>New in this release is the ability to configure an external merge tool to be
            called during the upgrade process. You can do this in a personal configuration
            file in your HOME directory. For example:
            
<pre>C:\Users\Me>md .sencha
C:\Users\Me>cd .sencha
C:\Users\Me\.sencha>md cmd
C:\Users\Me\.sencha>cd cmd
C:\Users\Me\.sencha\cmd>notepad sencha.cfg</pre>

        <p>For example, you add these entries like those below to use the
            <a href="http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools">
                Perforce Visual Merge tool</a>:

<pre>cmd.merge.tool=C:\\Program Files\\Perforce\\p4merge.exe
cmd.merge.tool.args=${cmd.merge.tool.args.p4merge}</pre>

        <p>For further details, consult the comments in the <tt>"sencha.cfg"</tt> file
            in your install folder of Sencha Cmd. The support for personal Sencha Cmd
            configuration files is also documented in that same file.

        <h1>Release Notes for Sencha Cmd 3.1.0 Beta</h1>
        <p class="notes">
            Date: February 13, 2013<br>
            Version Number: 3.1.0.130
        </p>

        <p><b>Ext JS:</b> This version of Sencha Cmd 3.1 is not compatible with Ext JS 4.1.x
            but this will be corrected in the next release. For this release, only 
            Ext JS 4.2.0.488 is supported.

        <p><b>Sencha Touch:</b> This version of Sencha Cmd 3.1 is compatible with 
            Sencha Touch 2.1+ however the new optimizer and package features (discussed
            below) are not yet supported for Sencha Touch applications.

        <h2>Class Optimizer</h2>

        <p>This release of Sencha Cmd introduces the <tt>optimize</tt> command on the
            Compiler. The initial optimization provided is to rewrite class declarations
            into a more optimal form. This is beneficial because compiled code avoid many
            run-time checks and process things synchronously (vs. asynchronously as with
            the Sencha class system). This results is significantly fewer function calls
            and memory allocation required to load the JavaScript code of the framework
            and application.
            
        <h2>Packages</h2>
        <p>The biggest new feature of Sencha Cmd 3.1 is that of packages. These are in
            many ways similar to applications from a build perspective. Like applications,
            packages contain:
            
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript
            <li>SASS
            <li>Resources
        </ul>

        <p>Packages come in three basic flavors: theme, code and locale. All package types
            can contain any of the above assets. They primarily differ in how applications
            use them. For theme and locale packages, only one of each can be active during
            a given build. An application may require multiple theme and locale packages,
            but only one will be activated for a build based on build properties. The
            defaults are stored in your <tt>.sencha/app/sencha.cfg</tt> file and these
            can be specified on the command line to override the default.

        <p>Packages live at the top of the application/workspace in a <tt>"./packages"</tt>
            folder. That is, package "foo" is stored in <tt>"./packages/foo"</tt>. In this
            release, only Ext JS 4.2 applications or other packages can use packages. In
            order to use a package, an application "requires" it in its app.json file:
<pre>
{
    "name": "foo",
    "type": "code",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "compatVersion": "1.0.0",
    "requires": [{
        "name": "bar",
        "version": "1.1.0"
    }]
}
</pre>
        <p>Packages can require other packages in their "package.json" file in the same way.
            Guides describing all of the particulars of packages will be available soon.

            Release Date: October 25, 2012<br>
            Version Number: 3.0.0.230
        </p>
        <h2>Highlights</h2>

        <p>The highlights are improved UTF-8/multi-charset handling and correcting the
        overwriting issues with "sencha app upgrade". To use the new charset directive in
        your JS files, place this as the first line:</p>

        <pre>
    //@charset ISO-8859-1</pre>
        
        <p>Instead of "ISO-8859-1", the value to the right of <code>charset</code> can be
        any valid Java
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html">charset</a>
        name. The default is "UTF-8".</p>

        <p>The <code>charset</code> directive is used to describe the encoding of an input
        file to the compiler. This does not effect the encoding of the output file. The
        content of the input file is converted to Unicode internally.</p>

        <p>Also, auto-dependency detection has been improved so there should be fewer cases
        where you need "requires" or "uses" for the compiler and not the dev environment
        (due to synchronous loading).</p>

        <h1>Release Notes for Sencha Cmd 3.0.0 Beta 2</h1>
        <p class="notes">
            Release Date: September 26, 2012<br>
            Version Number: 3.0.0.181
        </p>
        <h2>Customizable Builds</h2>
        
        <p>In this release we have introduced a new, top-level build script to provide a
        consistent and customizable build process for Ext JS and Sencha Touch applications
        The "sencha app build" is one way to perform an application build. This now calls
        in to an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">Ant</a> script to perform
        the actual build. This means the build can now be customized as needed.</p>

        <p>The Ant equivalent of "sencha app build [production|testing|native|package]" is:</p>
        
        <pre>
    sencha ant [production|testing|native|package] build</pre>
        
        If you have Ant in your PATH, you can use it directly:

        <pre>
    ant [production|testing|native|package] build</pre>

        <p>This runs the generated Ant build script to build your application. The reason
        the arguments are swapped vs "sencha app build" is to accommodate how Ant processes
        the command line.</p>
        
        <p>That's all that is necessary to use the Ant script. You don't have to do
        anything extra to get Ant (it is provided by Sencha Cmd) and you don't have to
        know anything about Ant. That is, unless you want to customize the build script.</p>

        <p>For details on tuning your application's Ant build script, start by reading the
        comments contained in "build.xml" (the Ant build script). Also you can consult the
        <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html" target="_blank">Ant Manual</a>
        for details on using Ant.</p>
        
        <p>Alternatively, you can chose to wrap your own build process around the
        "sencha app build" command.</p>
