# NOTE: These are here because translators often translate *everything*
#       in a message file, even reserved keywords! So we provide a way
#       to specify translations of those keywords. It avoids a lot of
#       issues this way...

#
# Date matching formats
#

# The format{number}.pattern messages contain the regular-expression
# pattern that will be used when looking for matches in text. They
# are standard JavaScript RegExp patterns with a few differences:
#
# 0) All patterns are prefixed and suffixed with the word-boundary
#    regular expression pattern "\\b" by default
#
# This keeps the patterns defined in the translation file clean and
# easier to read. If the pattern should NOT be modified with word-
# boundaries, then the the format{number}.boundary message should
# be set to "false" (or whatever boundaryFalse is defined as).
#
# 1) All occurrences of a space will be replaced by \\s+
#
# This is a convenience so that it's easier for translators to
# understand and create the patterns for the various locales.
#
# 2) All occurrences of (...) will be replaced by (?:...)
#
# Again, this makes the pattern more readable and will cause less
# translation errors.
#
# 3) All occurrences of {keyword} will be replaced by a
#    regular expression for that keyword match.
#
# The following keyword replacements are supported:
#
#   {number}     A number
#   {yearnum}    The 2 or 4-digit year
#   {monthnum}   The month number (January = 1, ...)
#   {monthname}  The name of a month consisting of all of the
#                possible month names defined in AjxMsg: from
#                AjxMsg["calc.monthname.january"] through
#                AjxMsg["calc.monthname.december"].
#   {datenum}    The date number of the month (1..31)
#   {dayname}    The name of the day of the week (Monday, ...)
#   {weekord}    The week ordinal (first, second, ... last)   
#
# For each pattern, there is a format{number}.rule message that
# describes how to convert the matched text into the equivalent
# Date object. These messages follow a specific pattern which
# contains keywords. These keywords are defined in AjxMsg and
# must match or else the patterns will not map correctly to the
# date they represent.
#
# Each date calculator rule is a string that specifies the base
# date/time, optionally followed by a sequence of adjustments to
# that date/time. The base date/time can be specified in two ways.
# It can be specified as the context date/time object using the
# following keyword:
#
#   now
#
# And you can specify a specific date/time using any of the
# following formats: [Note: these patterns follow the formats
# documented in java.util.SimpleDateFormat.]
#
#   yyyy-MM-dd
#   yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss
#   yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'
#
# NOTE: The last format represents a UTC date; the returned
#       date object is adjusted to local system time.
#
# The following adjustments can be made after specifying the base
# date/time:
#
#   +{number} (second[s]|minute[s]|hour[s]|day[s]|week[s]|month[s]|year[s])
#   +{number} {monthname}
#   +{number} {dayname}
#   -{number} (second[s]|minute[s]|hour[s]|day[s]|week[s]|month[s]|year[s])
#   -{number} {month_name}
#   -{number} {day_name}
#   milliseconds={milliseconds}
#   seconds={seconds}[,{milliseconds}]
#   minutes={minutes}[,{seconds}[,{milliseconds}]]
#   hours={hours}[,{minutes}[,{seconds}[,{milliseconds}]]]
#   date={date}
#   week={weekord}[,{dayname}]
#   month={month}[,{date}]
#   year={year}[,{month}[,{date}]]
#
# NOTE: A translation can add as many (or as few) patterns as they want.
#       The only requirement is that the last pattern be designed with
#       the message "###".
#
# NOTE: Order is important. The patterns that appear first will execute
#       first and their matches will take precedence over later ones.

#Note: This *must* be false for all asian languages.
