# skipRegEx: These are the words, seperated by |, that are commonly used with numbers. 
# To match addresses of various countries we need to make the regular expression very generic
#For example: 
#"2500 fashion island blvd, san mateo, ca 94403" is an address.
#but, "2500 major bugs found in Zimbra, out of 94403 'bugs" is not an address.
# So we have the following commonly used words like: "out of" or "as many" etc to ignore after
# we have matched.
#When translating, please use what ever words or set of words that's commonly used with numbers
# and seperate them with |
skipRegex = of which|as many|out of|none of|little as|where as
